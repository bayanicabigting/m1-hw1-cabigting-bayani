## About Me
My name is Bayani Cabigting, or just Bay for short. I love making art and sewing cosplays, and I love to collect vintage toys like Furbys and eccentric porcelain clown dolls. I miss Munch's Make Believe Band every day.
## Past Coding Experience
I don't realy have much experience with coding. I have messed around with suuuper basic html and css to make silly single-page sites like "My Top 5 Favorite Vampires" or "Clown Adoption Center" with a list of random clown doodles I made. I've also messed around a little bit with the Ink interactive narrative text language for previous Interactive Fiction/Game Design classes.
## Career Goals
I hope to somehow claw my way into one of these fields:
1. Branding Graphic Design
2. Communications Specialist for an Art Museum
3. Advertisment/Branding Animation
